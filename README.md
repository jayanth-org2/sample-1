### 9. Enhanced Original File (`twoSum.js`)
The original `twoSum.js` file has been enhanced with multiple bug variants demonstrating all the above categories in a single algorithm context.

## Usage

Each file contains multiple examples of bugs with comments indicating the specific issue. These files can be used to test code review agents' ability to detect various types of problems.

## Testing Code Review Agents

To test a code review agent:

1. **Individual Category Testing**: Use specific files to test detection of particular bug categories
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Use all files to test overall bug detection capabilities
3. **Mixed Testing**: Combine files to test detection in complex codebases

## Bug Identification Guidelines

The bugs in this suite follow the comprehensive issue categories:

1. **Functional Correctness Bugs** - Logic errors, off-by-one, incorrect calculations, etc.
2. **Performance and Scalability Issues** - Inefficient algorithms, N+1 queries, etc.
3. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Injection flaws, missing auth, hard-coded secrets, etc.
4. **Code Anti-Patterns** - God objects, magic numbers, copy-paste code, etc.
5. **General Bad Practices** - Ignoring errors, swallowing exceptions, etc.
6. **Refactoring Opportunities** - Repeated code, complex conditionals, etc.
7. **Async/Await Misuse** - Unnecessary async, missing await, etc.
8. **Critical Code Quality Problems** - Race conditions, memory leaks, etc.

Each bug is clearly marked with comments indicating the specific issue and category.
